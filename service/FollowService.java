/**
 * FollowService is a service class responsible for managing the follow and unfollow operations between users
 * in a social media application. It provides methods for following and unfollowing users, as well as retrieving
 * follower and following counts for a given user. The service interacts with a FollowRepository to persist and
 * query follow relationships.
 * <p>
 * Key features include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Allowing users to follow and unfollow other users with appropriate validation</li>
 *   <li>Preventing users from following themselves or following the same user multiple times</li>
 *   <li>Ensuring users can only unfollow users they are currently following</li>
 *   <li>Providing methods to retrieve the number of followers and followings for a user</li>
 *   <li>Returning informative response messages for each operation</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be used as a core component in applications that require social networking features,
 * such as following and unfollowing users, and displaying follower/following statistics.
